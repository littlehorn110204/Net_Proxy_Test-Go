# Net_Proxy_Test-Go
## Net proxy testing is a function that proxies data 
## between an io.Reader and an io.Writer which may be 
## applied to more than network connections and much 
## easier to test...
### The proxy runs through a series of tests to verify
### ping/pong replies.

# To run, chmod +x proxy_test.go
## go test -race -v proxy_test.go
